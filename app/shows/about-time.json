    "release": "\"Last year I had an idea. It was on a weekday in early spring - one of those days when all of the sudden there are leaves on the trees, where just yesterday there was only a leaf here or there, right after the threshold of \"leaves\" but before \"leaves\" becomes ubiquitous. The good idea happened when I was driving. It happened because I was thinking of telling a story in your voice- well not yours, but hers. Not hers, but, anyway someone else's. A voice that you use to read a book to a child, without condescension, but also with slightly over-emphasized diction, clear, without hesitation. In this voice anything sounds sensical, believable and good, but also trivial, without grave consequence. You could say \"Honey the house is on fire. Let's pull out our teeth and run for it\" or \"I've decided to buy that newspaper stand\" in this voice and conjure up, in any mind, the flattest drawings of the scenes, the black outlines of every subject filled with even swaths of primary color. The light was coming through those very new leaves, the way it does, making a dappled effect on the ground, or quick flashes if you're moving. Your eyes have a hard time adjusting to the dashing light and it leaves a greenish after image. I was thinking: the spring is beautiful. Probably, there was some music playing on the radio. I was going to write all this as if she were saying it, but then so much time had passed.\" <br /><br /> - Sarah Elliott, 2014",
